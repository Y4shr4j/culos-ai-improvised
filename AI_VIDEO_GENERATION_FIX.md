# AI Video Generation Fix - S3 Upload & Database Storage

## Problem
AI video generation was not saving videos to S3 bucket or the video gallery like AI image generation does. Videos were only returned as base64 data URLs, which meant:
- Videos were not persisted
- They weren't available in the video gallery
- They were lost when the page refreshed
- They consumed more bandwidth (base64 is ~33% larger)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Updated Video Generation Endpoint (`server/src/app.ts`)

**Changes made:**
- Added AWS S3 configuration validation
- Changed video handling from base64 data URLs to Buffer objects
- Added S3 upload functionality using `uploadToS3()` function
- Added database saving using `VideoModel`
- Added proper error handling and logging

**Key improvements:**
```javascript
// Before: Return base64 data URL
videoUrl = `data:video/mp4;base64,${artifact.base64}`;

// After: Convert to buffer and upload to S3
videoBuffer = Buffer.from(artifact.base64, 'base64');
const s3Url = await uploadToS3({
  originalname: `ai-generated-video-${Date.now()}.mp4`,
  mimetype: "video/mp4",
  buffer: videoBuffer,
  size: videoBuffer.length,
}, 'videos');
```

### 2. Updated Video Model (`server/src/models/video.ts`)

**Added new fields for AI-generated videos:**
- `prompt`: Stores the text prompt used for generation
- `categorySelections`: Stores category context and selections

**Interface updates:**
```typescript
export interface IVideo extends Document {
  // ... existing fields
  prompt?: string; // For AI-generated videos
  categorySelections?: Record<string, any>; // For AI-generated videos
  // ... rest of fields
}
```

### 3. Updated Client-Side Code (`client/pages/general/AIVideoGeneration.tsx`)

**Changes made:**
- Added prompt to form data so it can be saved with video metadata
- Improved error handling and user feedback

```javascript
// Add prompt to form data
if (promptText) {
  formData.append("prompt", promptText);
}
```

## How It Works Now

### 1. Video Generation Process
1. User uploads image or provides prompt
2. Image is sent to Stability AI video generation API
3. Video is generated and returned as base64
4. Base64 is converted to Buffer
5. Buffer is uploaded to S3 in `videos/` folder
6. Video metadata is saved to database using `VideoModel`
7. S3 URL is returned to client

### 2. Database Storage
Videos are now saved with:
- **URL**: S3 URL for video access
- **Title**: Auto-generated from prompt
- **Description**: Prompt or default description
- **Prompt**: Original text prompt (if provided)
- **Category**: Set to 'ai-generated'
- **Tags**: Includes 'ai-generated', 'video', and category context
- **Metadata**: Size, MIME type, uploader info
- **Unlock settings**: Free (unlockPrice: 0, isBlurred: false)

### 3. Video Gallery Integration
- Generated videos now appear in the video gallery
- They're searchable and filterable
- Users can view them without additional tokens
- Videos persist across sessions

## Benefits

### ✅ **Persistence**
- Videos are permanently stored in S3
- Available in video gallery
- Survive page refreshes and sessions

### ✅ **Performance**
- Reduced bandwidth usage (no base64 overhead)
- Faster loading from S3 CDN
- Better caching

### ✅ **User Experience**
- Videos appear in gallery immediately
- Consistent with image generation behavior
- Better discoverability

### ✅ **Admin Features**
- Videos can be managed through admin panel
- Blur/unblur functionality available
- Analytics and tracking possible

## Testing

A test script has been created (`server/test-video-generation.js`) to verify:
- Environment configuration
- User registration and authentication
- Token system
- Image generation
- Video generation with S3 upload
- Database saving

## Environment Variables Required

Make sure these are set in your environment:
```bash
# Stability AI
STABILITY_API_KEY=your_stability_api_key

# AWS S3
AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your_aws_access_key
AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your_aws_secret_key
AWS_REGION=us-east-2
AWS_S3_BUCKET=your_bucket_name

# Database
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
```

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy the changes** to your production environment
2. **Test the video generation** with real users
3. **Monitor S3 storage usage** and costs
4. **Consider adding video thumbnails** for better gallery experience
5. **Add video duration extraction** for better metadata
