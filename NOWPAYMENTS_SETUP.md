Set these in your Railway dashboard:
- `NOWPAYMENTS_API_KEY`: Your NOWPayments API key
- `FRONTEND_URL`: Your frontend domain
- `CLIENT_URL`: Your frontend domain
- `BACKEND_URL`: Your Railway backend URL

### 2. NOWPayments Dashboard Configuration

#### Webhook URL
Set the webhook URL in NOWPayments dashboard:
```
https://culosai-production.up.railway.app/api/payment/crypto/webhook
```

#### IPN Settings
- Enable IPN (Instant Payment Notifications)
- Set IPN URL to the webhook URL above
- Enable all payment status notifications

### 3. Domain Verification
For domain verification, choose one method:

#### Option A: Meta Tag
Add to your `client/index.html`:
```html
<head>
  <meta name="nowpayments-verification" content="YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE">
</head>
```

#### Option B: HTML File
Create `client/public/nowpayments-verification.html`:
```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>NOWPayments Verification</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>NOWPayments Domain Verification</h1>
  <p>Verification Code: YOUR_VERIFICATION_CODE</p>
</body>
</html>
```

## üí∞ Token Packages

The system supports these token packages:

| Package ID | Tokens | Price (USD) |
|------------|--------|-------------|

| `50-tokens` | 50 | $10.00 |
| `100-tokens` | 100 | $18.00 |

5. **Webhook received** ‚Üí NOWPayments notifies your server
6. **Tokens credited** ‚Üí User receives tokens automatically
